/**
 * CastServiceContract — the wire-visible constants of [CastService] as a plain
 * Kotlin object with zero Android dependencies.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: [CastService] cannot compile in the standalone JVM test
 * runner (android.app.Service + AndroidX + generated R), so
 * `test-runner/src/stubs/CastService.kt` substitutes a stub class. Before this
 * object, the action strings and IDs lived as hand-copied literals in BOTH
 * files — the stub's own KDoc demanded "every value here MUST match the real
 * service exactly" and relied on CastServiceTest to catch drift after the
 * fact. Now both the real companion and the stub re-export this one source, so
 * drift is structurally impossible — the same guarantee [ConnectionMapping]
 * already gives the state-mapping table.
 *
 * WIRE CONTRACT: the ACTION strings are sent by [ServiceController] and
 * matched in [CastService.onStartCommand]; CHANNEL_ID / NOTIFICATION_ID are
 * stable-across-upgrade identifiers (renaming the channel abandons the old
 * channel's user settings).
