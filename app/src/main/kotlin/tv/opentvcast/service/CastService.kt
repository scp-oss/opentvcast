/**
 * CastService — Android ForegroundService that hosts all receiver protocols.
 *
 * WHY: The AirPlay/Miracast/Cast receivers need to run continuously in the background.
 * Android may kill background processes. A ForegroundService with a persistent
 * notification keeps the app alive and shows the user that opentvcast is active.
 *
 * HOW: Bind to this service from [MainActivity] to receive state updates.
 * Use [ServiceController] to send start/stop/restart commands.
 *
 * Service lifecycle:
 *   startForegroundService() → onCreate() → onStartCommand() → [running in background]
 *   stopSelf() / stopService() → onDestroy() → all receivers stopped
 *
 * Commands via Intent actions (sent by [ServiceController]):
 *   ACTION_START   — starts all enabled receivers
 *   ACTION_STOP    — stops all receivers and stops the service
 *   ACTION_RESTART — stops then starts all receivers (service keeps running)
