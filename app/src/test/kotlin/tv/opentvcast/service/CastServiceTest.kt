/**
 * CastServiceTest — Unit tests for [CastService].
 *
 * WHY: [CastService] is the central coordinator. Bugs in its state aggregation
 * logic or intent routing cause symptoms that are hard to debug (service not starting,
 * wrong notification text, connection not registered).
 *
 * WHAT WE TEST:
 * - The Intent action constants have the expected package-qualified strings
 * - The notification channel ID and notification ID are stable across code changes
 * - The [ProtocolState] → [ActiveConnection] mapping logic is correct
 * - [ProtocolState.CONNECTED] creates an [ActiveConnection] for the right protocol
 * - Non-CONNECTED states clear the [ActiveConnection]
 *
 * HOW: [CastService] is an Android [Service] and requires Android APIs for
 * full lifecycle testing. That is covered by instrumentation tests.
 * Here we test only:
 *   1. Companion constants (compile-time safe)
 *   2. The `onStateChanged` callback logic, extracted as a pure lambda so it
 *      can be tested without an Android runtime.
 *
 * NOTE: Android Service, Notification, and Context are NOT used in any test here.

    // shows the streaming status. If CONNECTING doesn't clear it, a stale session
    // lingers while the sender is still negotiating.
